Torrent Manager

Torretta is a torrent manager that crawls the web looking for torrents that match a given query. It supports (or at least will) different backends for the most common torrent websites.


TODO:
    * Add more backends
    * Add support for torrent clients (So far it writes the downloaded torrent in the filesystem)
    * Cache torrent searches
    * Fix manager commands
